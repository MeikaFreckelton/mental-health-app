# Mental Health App

I've decided to create this application as a side project to help myself in managing my life and improving all different areas of my own health. I want one place where i can organise my daily tasks, track my habits and my moods, keep a personal journal, track my workouts and set goals. I'm also using this project to improve my knowledge in react-redux, the backend, databases as well as keeping my tech skills up to date and contiuing my learning.
